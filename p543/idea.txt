Using Goldbach's conjecture and the fact we can use 2 as we need:
P(n,k)=1 for k>2 and n>=k*2
Using common sense:
P(n,k)=0 for k>2 and n<k*2
P(n,1)=1 for prime n, P(n,1)=0 otherwise
P(n,2) is the question

P(n,1)+P(n,2)=2 for prime twins (n-2, n) only
P(n,1)+P(n,2)=1 if n is prime but the above doesn't hold; or if n is even
P(n,1)+P(n,2)=0 otherwise
